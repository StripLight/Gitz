Integration tests

A number of integration tests are provided these need a set of repositories to support this.

By default these are:

# 'Server' is a bare repository acting as the remote repository for the 2 local clones
/temp/work/server

# two clones of server
/temp/work/local
/temp/work/scruffy



Set these up as follows:

This assumes /temp/work exists

#
# Setup the remote

cd /temp/work
mkdir server
cd server

git init --bare

cd ..

#
# Create local clone
git clone server ./local

cd local

#
# verify the repo
git remote -v
origin  C:/temp/work/server (fetch)
origin  C:/temp/work/server (push)

#
# do stuff, add a file, and push

dir > a.txt
git add ./
git commit -m "Added a.txt"

git push --all origin

#
# create second clone
cd ..
git clone server ./scruffy

cd scruffy

#
# leave it with pending work
dir > b.txt




Feel free to change and augment, but update the test manifests appropriately.
